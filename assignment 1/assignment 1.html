            <li>BUS118W will cover the concepts of web-based technology and technologies related
                to it. As part of the course, students will learn how to design and program websites
                written in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. As part of the course, students will also

    <h4>Part 3: Embed the following youtube video on HTTP & HTML and critically review it.</h4>

    <!-- iframe function and embed URL to put video in website-->

    <iframe width="420" height="315" src = "https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_2_8n86jA8"></iframe>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>This video introduces HTTP protocol and how a computer uses HTTP to read HTML so
                that our computers can display websites. The lecture also covers cookies and their
                role in remembering our information on the websites we visited.
            </li>
            <li>I learned what the purpose of the headers found at the start of each HTML 
                page are used for. I also learned how cookies are used by websites. 
            </li>
            <li>My suggestion for this video is for the presenter to speak slower and louder at
                some parts; sometimes I can't understand what he's trying to say because
                it sounds like he's mumbling.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h4>Part 4: Also embed a Google map of SJSU.</h4>
